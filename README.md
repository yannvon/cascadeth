# Consensus on Demand 
Fork of the Official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol and inspired by the Cascade protocol.

## Quick start

The simplest way to test Cascadeth is to run one of the test scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory. 
The most important commands are explained using an example bash script that can be found in `scripts/thesis-example/launch.sh`.

In this example, we will boot a local network containing four nodes, three of them being validators. The first step consists in cloning the repository, and installing Cascadeth and its tools by running:

`go install --ldflags '-extldflags "-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition"' -v ./cmd/geth` 

### Genesis & Multishot contract

Next, the genesis file shall be adapted. We will use the genesis that can be found in `scripts/thesis-example/genesis.json`. There are 5 accounts, as in this example one node has two (in general, nodes are free to access as many wallets as they like). Three of the nodes are servers/validators, and are thus listed in extraData. Their cumulative stake is stored in totalStake. The following command creates the required data directory, and needs to be performed for each node.

`geth init --datadir node0 genesis.json`

Then, the Multishot contract needs to be deployed, with the same three validator addresses and stake amount as parameter. Each validator must be sent a sufficient amount of ether on the Rinkeby network.

### Starting nodes

Nodes are equipped to perform automated network discovery, essentially probing the network until they find nodes that support the same protocol, use the same chainID and have the same genesis file. Although accurate, scan times are variable. The discovery process can be sped up by limiting the network to a sub-mask, or by manually adding each peer via the RPC interface.

Here we will use a different method, by starting a separate _bootnode_. This process has the sole purpose of allowing quick network discovery, by informing each node of the other nodes present. 

`bootnode --nodekey bootnode.key \&`

Finally, a cascadeth node is run as follows:

`geth --datadir node0 --gcmode archive --bootnodes BOOTNODE --metrics --metrics.addr 127.0.0.1 --metrics.port 6061 --networkid 15 --port 30303 --http.port 8101 --syncmode full --verbosity 5 --cache.snapshot 0 --ipcpath geth0.ipc --netrestrict 127.0.0.0/24 --unlock 0x8d0448e9109d5d93a77061918ded588ddb8ebe97 --password password.txt \&> logs/geth0.log \&`

### Performing transactions

The three validator nodes need to be individually instructed to start mining, i.e. creating blocks containing acknowledgements:

`geth attach node0/geth0.ipc --exec "miner.start(0)"`

Assuming the account is already unlocked (as was done above when launching the node), we can now perform a transaction as follows: 

`geth attach node0/geth0.ipc --exec "eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.accounts[0], to: eth.accounts[1], value: 1000000000000000000, gas: 21000, gasPrice: 100000000000})"`

After a short amount of time, the new account balance in Ether can be read as follows:

`geth attach node0/geth0.ipc --exec "web3.fromWei (eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0]), 'ether')"`



## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.13 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **`geth`**   | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options.          |
|   `abigen`    | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details. |
|  `bootnode`   | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols.

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.


### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```


### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
